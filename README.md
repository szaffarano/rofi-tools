Note: Only tested with [rofi-wayland](https://github.com/lbonn/rofi), although
it should work with the [official version](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi).

## Cliphist integration

A WIP integration with `cliphist` to show both text and images in a Rofi menu.
Requires [wl-clipboard](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard) and of course
[cliphist](https://github.com/sentriz/cliphist).

Since I wanted to use different layouts/rofi configurations for texts and
images, neither the `script` mode nor a custom mode/plugin were valid options
because it's impossible to dynamically update the layout without re-launching
Rofi (more info [here](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/issues/1356)).

### Usage

Just build the tool or download the [latest
release](https://github.com/szaffarano/rofi-tools/releases) and add the binary
to your path.

It's also exposed as a Nix flake. Add the input to your `flake.nix`

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    wofi-tools = {
      url = "github:szaffarano/rofi-tools";
      inputs = {
        nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
      };
    };
  }
}
```

And reference the package as usual, e.g.,

```nix
home.packages = [
  inputs.rofi-tools.packages.${pkgs.system}.rofi-cliphist
];
```

And finally call it

```bash
path/to/cliphist-rofi
```

It will show by default all non-binary cliphist entries. You can switch between
text/image mode by using `Alt-t` / `Alt-i` and also delete entries using
`Alt-d`.

![Image Mode](./img/img-mode.png)

### Configuration

- Through the command line:

```bash
Usage: rofi-cliphist [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -v, --verbose                          Show verbose output
  -r, --rofi-path <ROFI_PATH>            Path to rofi executable [default: rofi]
  -c, --cliphist-path <CLIPHIST_PATH>    Path to cliphist executable [default: cliphist]
  -w, --clipboard-path <CLIPBOARD_PATH>  Path to wl-copy executable [default: wl-copy]
  -f, --config <FILE>                    Sets a custom config file
  -h, --help                             Print help
  -V, --version                          Print version
```

- Through a configuration file, either on `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rofi-cliphist.toml`
or the path specified using the `-f/--config` flag

```toml
[rofi]
path = "rofi"

[cliphist]
path = "cliphist"

[clipboard]
path = "wl-copy"

[text_mode_config]
title = "Text"
shortcut = "Alt+t"
description = "Switch to text mode"

[image_mode_config]
title = "Image"
shortcut = "Alt+i"
description = "Switch to image mode!"

[delete_mode_config]
title = "Delete"
shortcut = "Alt+d"
description = "Delete entry"
```
